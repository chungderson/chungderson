## About Me

I'm Anderson Chung, a Statistics & Machine Learning undergraduate at ***Carnegie Mellon University***. I enjoy puzzles and creating fun little finance/econometrics side projects, and I hope to double-major in economics.

## Interests

- Equity research and fundamental analysis
- Applied econometrics and statistical modeling
- Financial markets education and communication (check out my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/quant_andy) if you haven't already!)

My end goal is to tangibly help the world. I aspire to build something (a product, perchance) that addresses a real problem and drives meaningful impact. If you have an issue that you'd like me to solve, please contact me below.
